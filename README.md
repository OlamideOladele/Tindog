This was my first full project ever, thanks to Angela Yu, The App Brewery and Udemy for the inspo for this, (it was technically a class project).
This is a clone for the tinder app made for dogs, its a simple landing page, fully responsive that was made using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and a little javascript (just one line actually).
